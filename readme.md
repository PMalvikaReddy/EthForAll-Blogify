# Blogchain.ai-EthforAll
## Introduction

You may have heard of AI generated images, but what if these images can be specific to blogs, what if blogs could be visually appealing. According to research image-based blogs have higher user engagement and readership than text-based blogs as they appeal to visual learners.

Hence, Presenting Blogchain.ai, an interactive AI image generator for blogs which is in turn used to create NFTs which are blockchain-based tokens that each represent a unique AI generated image.This project integrates AI and web3 technologies to create a visually appealing blog interface.

This enitre project has been developed using web 3.0 technologies that enable decentralization, personalization, immersiveness, and a token-driven economy. It provides user with a personalized web surfing experience. The project aims at making blog sharing decentralised using web 3.0 technologies like FVM, Arcana, IPFS, PUSH Protocol, Chainlink etc.

The project creates an NFT using the cover image of the blog and encodes the blog text into the image using image steganography. This helps users share their content using a single NFT hence increasing the shareability and readability of these blogs.
## Technologies
- ### Arcana -
    The project is integrated with ARCANA sdk for User Authentication. It enables a familiar Web2 user onboarding experience in our Web3 application. The user requires to login to access the features of the website such as to read and create blogs. The user can create visually appealling blog images as such as create NFTs with the blog content only once the user is verified. Users can either use their google account or email id to login and use the features of the platform.
    
    Here, is a quick demonstration of ARCANA implemented in the project for user verification:-


- ### PUSH Protocol -
    After successful authentication, the user can create a blog which is processed on the backend to generate an AI image which is inturn used to create a NFT. This NFT is minted with the smart contract deployed to FVM. Once the NFT is minted, it generates a PUSH notification  that is sent to all the users across the channel. The PUSH notification shows the members the details of the blog as well as the NFT image.
    
    Here, is a demonstration of PUSH notifications implemented in the project to send notifications to all users about the newly minted NFTs and the created blogs:-
    
- ### Chainlink -
    This project focusses on creating NFTs using AI generated images and keywords from a specific blog, which can prove to be an expensive process on the blockchain hence needs to be processed off-chain. CHAINLINK is used to access a custom created external api hosted onine to perform computations and load the data onto the blockchain.
    
    Here, is the demonstration of chainlink into the project to provide data and information from off-blockchain sources to on-blockchain smart contracts:- 

- ### IPFS -
    

- ### FVM -
